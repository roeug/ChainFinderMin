Idea was to make ChainFinder code available for all (Win32/64 Linux64/32) platforms.       
win32 version is at https://rsicc.ornl.gov/codes/ccc/ccc7/ccc-731.html

Codetyphon was used.

ChainFinderMinW32.exe  - window 32bit working, to be tested.
ChainFinderMinW64.exe  - window 64bit working, to be tested.
ChainFinderMinL32  - linux 32bit working, to be tested.
ChainFinderMinL64  - linux 64bit working, to be tested.
